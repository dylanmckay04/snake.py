Welcome to snake.py, a classic Snake game implemented using PyGame and pygbag. This game attempts to evoke feelings of nostalgia via arcade-style graphics and sound effects, hopefully bringing you back to the days of the Nokia. This is my first full-fledged PyGame project, and the development process has been extremely rewarding. I hope you enjoy!

INSTALLATION
